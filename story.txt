        People:
        - Mr.Billionaire
            Intro TEXT: "Welcome to the mansion! I'm so glad you could make it.
                         I'll be giving a toast soon. Make yourself comfortable."
            Toast TEXT: "*annoying clinging of silverware on a glass* I'd like to give a toast.
                         Welcome to my mansion! I know we'll have a great time. Let the sparks ignite."

            Stephanie TEXT: "Hi, I'm Stephanie! Isn't Mr. Billionaire so wonderful?
                             He's definitely a tall drink of water."
            Richie    TEXT: "I'm going to live up to my name and win Mr. Billionaire's heart!
                             Oh, beware of the water here. That stuff I had earlier was nasty.
                             Then again, maybe it does wonders for the skin..."

        Alfred Button (Hints):
        1. Talk to Mr. Billionaire

        ***PART I DONE***

        ***PART II START***
        Cutscene - All characters leave room, Spy is left alone to snoop
        Timed event to look for clue
        You have a certain amount of time to look for "water" after those words from Steph and Richie.

        3. Look in the trashcan. (Empty lighter fluid bottle. Hmm...not enough).
        4. Look at the table surfaces. (Drop of liquid, steers you in right direction in the room.)
        5. Look in the cabinets near the wet table.

        Find Clue: Find the water and sniff. This is lighter fluid! What is it doing disguised as water?

        Time Runs Out: You were obviously snooping...get out.

    Phase II -
        People:
        - Mr. Billionaire:
            Line to Use: "You light my heart on fire."

    Phase III -
        People:
        - Mr. Billionaire:
            Line to Use: "Nothing could extinguish my feelings for you."

    Outro -
        Dark and rainy.
        Spy is on another mission.

        Case file is for the butler...that's odd.
        He's a sophisticated criminal who is known for targeting
        wealthy individuals: dawning a new identity and setting their
        target up for a crime just to go undetected, stealing precious
        items from their target.

        To Be Continued...*thunder and lightening flash*
